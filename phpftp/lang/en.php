### is a simple and fast desktop FTP client replacement which even works
if you are behind firewalls and proxies.

To enter folders or download files simply <b>-double click-</b> these folders and
files in the lists. To go up in the directory structure click on the first entry
with the two dots (..) or use the directory selection list above.

Upload and download file size limits may not only be set in the configuration 
file (config.php), probably they have to be set accordingly on your webserver, 
firewall or proxy infrastructure too. Ask your provider or network adminstrator 
if you have problems here, not us please.

Configure ### in config/config.php and read the <a href='readme.txt'>readme.txt</a> carefully.
